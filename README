Crash Preview
-------------

This repository is a preview of upstream crash utility[1] with higher version
of gdb support, aiming to easy the work of the formal gdb upgrade of upstream
crash.

According to gdb release history[2], gdb-xx.2 will be released every year. So
crash preview is planed to do the gdb upgrade work every year after gdb-xx.2
is released. In the meantime, crash preview will constantly pick the patches
from upstream crash, and adapt the patches if needed. A '(M)' mark will
indicating the adaption of the patch.

Crash preview is NOT as stable as crash, though I will occasionally run
crash-testing[3] against crash & crash-preview, in order to find regressions.
But it is prefered for developer to use & test ONLY, and NOT suitable for
production use.
